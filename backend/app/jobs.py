"""Coding runs that execute on the server rather than in the browser's connection.

A normal run is driven by its HTTP stream: close the tab, lose the network, and
the generator is closed and the run dies. That is what loses work when someone's
internet drops mid-run.

A job here is the same coding run, started by a request that returns immediately
and then left to finish on its own. Progress is written to the ``coding_jobs``
row so any later request can read it, and the run is reachable at a page keyed by
an unguessable token.

Deliberate boundaries:

- **The API key is never stored.** It lives in the running task's frame and dies
  with it. A restart therefore cannot resume a run — such runs are marked
  ``interrupted`` on the next boot so nobody is left waiting for an email that
  will never arrive.
- **No participant data in the database.** The row holds counters and model
  names; coded rows stay in the temp directory the run writes.
- **Bounded.** A semaphore caps how many run at once and an episode ceiling caps
  how large one may be, so a forgotten run cannot spend without limit.
