"""Deploy/release history — the single source of truth for the app version.

Each deploy to production adds one entry to the TOP of RELEASES with the next
patch number and the date it shipped. The website shows the major.minor (e.g.
"1.2"); the admin Version History shows the full patch-level log below.

``__version__`` (in app/__init__.py) is derived from RELEASES[0], so bumping the
version is just prepending a new entry here.

Dates for entries up to 1.2.4 were reconstructed from the git merge history on
`main` (each merge to main is one deploy). Times are the release date (UAE).

        "notes": "Opening a server-side run's link now shows the same results view as the app — live results, validation, coder agreement, downloads and the run summary — instead of progress and a download button. The browser run also shows an estimate of the time remaining, which only the server-side run had.",

        "title": "Repeated runs sweep the whole dataset each time",
        "notes": "With more than one run per model, CAT now codes every episode once, then starts again from the first — rather than coding one episode repeatedly before moving on. Repeated measurements of the same episode are no longer taken back-to-back, and the progress bar counts every pass, so five episodes over three runs reads as fifteen.",

        "notes": "Starting a run on the server now opens the results column, and once it finishes the usual results view appears — live results, validation, coder agreement, downloads and the run summary — rather than progress alone. A run that cannot start also reports why in the run bar instead of failing silently.",

        "title": "Server-side runs are protected by an access key",
        "notes": "Opening a server-side run now needs both its link and an access key emailed alongside it. The key is entered on the page and never appears in the web address, so a link on its own no longer exposes anyone's results. Only a hash of the key is stored.",

            "A coding run can now be carried out on CAT's server instead of inside the "

            "run gets its own link showing live progress, a time estimate from its own "

            "emailed when the run finishes if an address was given. Opt-in: the browser path "
            "is unchanged. API keys are still never stored, and the email carries the link "
